<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project involved the implementation of a shopping cart system for a simple e-commerce interface. The HTML and CSS structure had already been developed, providing a static layout with three available product options and a pre-designed user interface. My role was to build the entire functional logic in JavaScript, transforming the static layout into an interactive and dynamic application.

The main objective was to develop the JavaScript functionality that would allow users to select an item, choose a quantity, and add it to the shopping cart. I began by designing a system that would capture the selected item and its corresponding quantity upon user interaction. One of the key challenges here was to ensure that the quantity entered by the user was a valid numerical value. I implemented input validation logic to handle incorrect or non-numeric entries gracefully, avoiding potential bugs or calculation errors.

Once a valid selection was confirmed, I needed to check whether the item already existed in the cart. If it did, the script would increment the quantity of that existing entry instead of duplicating it. This step was crucial for maintaining a clean, user-friendly cart interface. I also ensured that the HTML element representing the cart dynamically reflected these updates, both in terms of quantity and the visual display of items.

An essential part of the logic was the calculation of the subtotal for each product. This involved multiplying the unit price of the selected item by the quantity added to the cart. These calculations were handled in real time, ensuring that users received immediate visual feedback on the cost implications of their choices.

Finally, I implemented a function to sum the subtotals of all items in the cart and display the overall total. This total was updated every time a new item was added or an existing itemâ€™s quantity was changed, maintaining accuracy and responsiveness across all interactions.

This project served as a practical application of core JavaScript principles. It also helped reinforce important concepts related to user input validation and dynamic content rendering in the browser.

Beyond the technical experience, the project strengthened my understanding of how front-end logic supports real-world functionality in e-commerce environments. It was a valuable step toward writing clean, modular, and user-focused code, and it gave me insight into how interface logic integrates with business rules in practical web development.
